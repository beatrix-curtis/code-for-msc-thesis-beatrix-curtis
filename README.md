# code-for-msc-thesis-beatrix-curtis
This code has been used to run simulations for my MSc project using the Astrophysical Multipurpose Software Environment (AMUSE).
In order to run the code, AMUSE needs to be installed. 'cluster_binaries_high_masses_in_binaries.py', 'cluster_binaries_random_mass.py' are adapted from 'cluster.py' in the MASC module of AMUSE. 'binaries.py' is adapted from the 'binaries.py' in MASC.
